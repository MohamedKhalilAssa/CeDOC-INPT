If this is your first time importing the code, execute the setup script or copy application-secrets.properties.example into --> application-secrets.properties
and make sure to enter your valid information in it, as it was made to be sure no sensitive data gets pushed.

if you are to add in functionality do so in a separate branch (the one for your team). and inform the team of your progress afterwards before merging to main.

respect the packaging from class diagram and layers of the project.
